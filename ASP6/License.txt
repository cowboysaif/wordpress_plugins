END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT for the Auto Social Poster plugin ("ASP") created and/or edited by Interactive Gambit LLC

PLEASE READ THIS LICENSE CAREFULLY. 

This end-user license agreement ("EULA") is a legal agreement between you (an individual or a single entity) and Interactive Gambit LLC for all copyright with respect to ASP. By installing, copying, downloading, accessing or otherwise using ASP, you agree to be bound by the terms of this license agreement.  


1. GRANT OF USER LICENSE.

You have an individual user license for ASP, including any text, graphics, images or photographs contained therein. You have the right to install the plugins on personal and/or business related Wordpress blogs that belong to, or are owned by YOU. You do not have the license to install the plugins on blogs not owned by you. 


2. VOLUME RESTRICTION

The License is granted for a number of bookmarked posts. The actual maximum number of bookmarked posts depends on the type of license you purchased, as displayed in your account.

For instance, the ASP Gold -100,000x is valid up to a MAXIMUM of 100,000 bookmarked posts. EACH and EVERY time ANY post is bookmarked to ANY bookmark account, this will increment the 'bookmarking counter' by ONE (1). The license will cease to be valid once the 'bookmarking counter' has reached 100,000, i.e. once 100,000 posts have been bookmarked.

Please note that ALL bookmarks -including successful and failed ones- are counted. Once you have reached the maximum number of bookmarked posts, you may want to buy a new license or, if available, volume extensions license.


3. COPYRIGHT PROTECTION.

ASP (including but not limited to any technology, images, audio, text, and “applets” incorporated into the software product) is protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. All rights not expressly granted are reserved by Interactive Gambit LLC.

This agreement does not convey to you an interest in or to the ASP, but only a limited right to use the ASP, revocable in accordance with the terms of this agreement.

5. SITE UPDATES

As a reminder, ASP is used to bookmark blog’s posts to bookmarking sites. Because most if not all bookmarking sites are updating their login/posting process on a regular basis, it may happen from time to time that ASP is unable to post to several bookmarking sites. This is why we try to update the ASP code on a regular basis. 

Because of this ongoing process, we cannot guarantee that, at any point in time all the bookmarking sites listed in our documentation and/or our website will be properly configured. There could be and there will be posting errors. These posting error could occurred for a number of reasons, including the use of wrong username/password, changes in the login/posting error and/or server time out.

While we use reasonable efforts to update the list of bookmarking sites, we are not committed to a minimum number of bookmarking sites and/or to any specific bookmarking sites. We are also entitled to remove existing sites and/or add new sites on a discretionary basis.

You are welcome to signal to us any such posting errors you may encounter when using ASP. However, you fully understand and agree with the above. Therefore, you agree NOT to complain, criticize us, blame us and/or request a refund if and when encountering such posting errors.
